# csci30.33-jeopardy 

**Project Passes for my Guided Studies in JavaScript Development class.**

> We were tasked to utilize the jService API in creating a Jeopardy clone built using JavaScript. Each pass was dedicated to a certain aspect of the project.

📄 **Pass 1** 📄 

Pass 1 focused on retrieving data from the jService API. There were three options to choose from: XML requests, Promises, or the Fetch API. Other than this, we were tasked to design a question grid similar to an actual Jeopardy board. 

📋 **Pass 2** 📋

Pass 2 examined the manipulation of the data received through filtration. This was less on rendering game functions, and more on understanding the API response. Look into the console logs for the results.

✏️ **Pass 3** ✏️ 

Pass 3 looked into integrating the data into more of the game's functionality. Features such as increasing or decreasing the score, and question selection are a few of the features implemented. This was personally a little more fun because I got to get more hands-on with developing the application.

📄 **Pass 4** 📄 

Pass 4 explored the different other implementations that could be executed within the application. Other than allowing the students to personalize the project a little more, we were tasked to add animations and music to the game. However, one of the features I could not quite figure out was saving the game state per session. Nevertheless, it was a fun experience tinkering with different APIs and methods.

Evidently, looking back at this, this is not the best execution I could have done of the project. Yet, it was a fun experience jumping into the world of developing something of my own. Might want to revisit this little project in the future. ✅
